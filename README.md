## Customer Segmentation Analysis for Subscription Service
---

### Introduction

### Purpose:

### The purpose of this analysis is to segment customers of the subscription service to better understand their behaviors, preferences, and potential lifetime value. This segmentation will help inform personalized marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize product offerings.

### Business Context: 
### The subscription service offers three tiers: Basic, Premium, and Standard. By understanding customer patterns and segmenting them based on subscription type, region, and behavior (e.g., churn likelihood, duration of subscription), we aim to enhance decision-making and revenue growth.

- Revenue: Revenue generated by each customer.

- Region: Geographical region of the customer.

- Canceled: Indicates whether a customer has canceled their subscription (True/False).


Data Cleaning: Duplicates were removed from the table
